## Description

We implemented an intuitive marketplace for open science project creators and skilled potential contributors to identify one another and communicate. Our web application is based as a classic networking platform that has additional benefits and features. We used existing NASA records from given projects to fill our database with projects and authors. Other than that scientists and enthusiasts can create accounts so they can contribute or post their own open-source research. The recommendation algorithm is designed so it can divide projects by categories and level of expertise and contributors by their skill set in those categories. So this platform can mix and match to create the perfect combination of people who share similar passion and skills in certain topics. Additionally we have implemented a chat system so if you are interested to collaborate or like someone’s profile you can connect with them and have a professional conversation for future collaboration. This actually can help perspective-wise and can speed up our research processes as a community. We want to achieve a better, simpler, easier to use network for professionals and students, being able to communicate together and make something great. In the development process for the back-end part we used Supabase infrastructure with Typescript and front-end in Next.js. We designed the database and filled it with the open-source NASA records of the current projects. Additionally we designed the front-end with Figma, but since we were low on time we used some Tailwind and Shadcn reusable components.
In the AI field we just used ChatGPT for generating some of the catchy marketing text used in the landing page, but that is a language model so I’m not sure if it counts.
